# A Vibe Coded GitHub Contributions Graph

A reimagined take on the GitHub contributions heatmap â€” turning raw commit history into a spatial, interactive, and musical timeline of code.

> Built by ChatGPT
> Directed by PEZ, a human with strong vibes

## ðŸŒ± Purpose

This project explores how contribution data can be experienced, not just visualized.

Instead of the classic 2D grid:
- Each day becomes a 3D block, rising with activity.
- Months are laid out like calendar pages, spaced through depth.
- Hovering plays notes, turning commits into melodies.
- You can orbit, zoom, and fly over your timeline with keyboard controls.

The aim isn't just accuracy â€” it's resonance. We want it to feel like something.

## ðŸ§  How Itâ€™s Made

This graph is designed in collaboration between PEZ (the director) and ChatGPT (the implementer). The process is organic, iterative, and conversational:

- PEZ guides the direction: layout, aesthetic, mood.
- ChatGPT translates the intention into working code.
- Everything is tested live in the browser via Vite.
- If it doesn't vibe, it's rewritten. Quickly.

PEZ is a "vibe coder": not buried in implementation, but steering the energy. ChatGPT is the keyboard: rendering the vision in precise, flexible structures.

## ðŸŽ« Features

- 3D blocks, one per day
- Color and height reflect contribution volume
- Tooltip reveals exact date + count
- Hovering a block plays a musical note
- Sound toggle included
- Keyboard movement (WASD) lets you travel through your year
- Labels for months float alongside the data

## ðŸŽµ Sound Design

Notes are simple sine waves, pitched to match activity level:
- More contributions â†’ higher note
- Each plays once on hover, then fades
- Gentle by default, unless you're really active

## ðŸ§ª Running Locally

If you're just here to see it run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
